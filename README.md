## To Do List Using C++

C++ program implements a basic to do list in command line, it enables users to create new task files, add tasks, update existing ones, and delete tasks from a text file.

The program utilizes everything i known back then when i started learning and it's using standard C++ libraries for input/output operations, file handling, and string manipulation.

There is a chance to improve the code and separate each essential part of the program into a separate function, i do not write code anymore, so I will leave it here as a memory for me when i started learning how to write code
