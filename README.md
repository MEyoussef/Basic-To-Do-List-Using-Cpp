# To-Do-List-Using-Cpp

/*

    This code snippet is a C++ program that implements a to-do list application. It allows the user to perform various operations on a text file, such as adding, updating, and deleting tasks.

    Here's a high-level overview of the code:

    The program starts by creating a file stream object and a vector to store user tasks.
    It prompts the user to choose whether they want to check for existing .txt files.
    If the user chooses to check for files, the program prompts the user to enter a file name.
    If the file exists, the program prompts the user to choose an operation (Add, Update, or Delete).
    Depending on the chosen operation, the program performs the corresponding action (adding a new task, updating an existing task, or deleting a task).
    If the user chooses not to check for files, the program prompts the user to enter the number of tasks and a file name.
    The program then prompts the user to enter each task and saves them to the file.
    After the user has finished adding tasks, the program prompts the user to choose whether they want to update or delete any tasks.
    If the user chooses to update tasks, the program prompts the user to select a task to update and asks for the new task.
    If the user chooses to delete tasks, the program prompts the user to select a task to delete.
    Finally, the program displays the updated or deleted tasks and exits.
    The code snippet includes error handling and input validation to ensure that the program runs smoothly and handles user input correctly.
